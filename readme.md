# GitHub Project 2 Issues Lab
## Creating an Issue on your Fellow Developers Project 2 Full-Stack Application

Today you will be practicing fixing more GitHub issues. You will be reviewing two of your peers code and submitting two issues on each one of their Project 2 repos.

This weekend you will solve these issues.

- Head over to [GitHub's documentation on how to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and read up!

## Exercise

#### Requirements
- Line up in alphabetical order by first name.  The two people directly after you in the alphabet are the developers you will submit issues for.  For those at the end of alphabet, you will wrap around and submit issues for people at the beginning of the alphabet.
- For each of these two developers' code do the following:

  1. Clone their repo (you do not need to `fork` it, because you will not need to `push` to it.)
  2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser or go to their app's hosted site online and play around for a few minutes. Think about
    - Are there any bugs?
    - Is there improvement you think the project could make toward meeting requirements?
    - Are there any relatively simple features that could be added to make the experience better? ( A better-organized "new" page is doable.  Adding another 3rd party API, maybe not so much.)
  3. Spend at least 5 minutes looking at their code. Think about
    - Do you see any bad practices? (for example very long methods or poorly named variables)
  4. Take a look at the Issues page on [Garnet's GitHub repo]( https://github.com/ga-dc/garnet/issues) for some examples of how to name issues.
  4. Use your new skills from GitHub's issue documentation aboveto submit at least 2 (but no more than four) issues.

#### Deliverable

  The four issues you submit on your two fellow developers repos ARE your deliverable.

## This Weekends Assignment

### Make Your Project 2 Apps Portfolio Worthy!

This weekend you will do the following things to make this full-stack app worthy of your Portfolio!

1. Split out your model(s), view(s), and controller(s) into their own directories.
2. Solve *at least two* the issues on your repo. But as many as you reasonably can. Read up on [how to solve an issue and close it with a simple commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
3. Put some extra work into the design of your app. Make it beautiful! Make it modern! Add bootstrap if you like! Add some animations! Go nuts.

Your result will be a beautiful, functional full-stack app using all the technology concepts that employers usually want their developers to know!

### Additional Resources

- Become an issue guru by reading GitHub's [Mastering Issues Documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

### Self Evaluation

During the previous exercise, rate your progress on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest) for the following criteria:

- **Persistence:** Do you handle frustration well? Do you independently pursue understanding?
- **Organization:** Do you thoughtfully implement best coding patterns and practices?
- **Collaboration:** Do you make an effort solve problems and share your ideas with others?
- **Communication:** Do you clearly convey your thoughts to others in illustrative and clear ways?
- **Self-compassion:** Do you make productive use of turning failures into learning opportunities?
- **Resourcefulness:** Do make an effort to compare and contrast new ideas with ones you already know?
