# GitHub Project 2 Issues Lab
## Creating an Issue on your Fellow Developers Project 2 Full-Stack Application

Today you will be practicing fixing more GitHub issues. You will be reviewing two of your peers code and submitting two issues on each one of their Project 2 repos.

This weekend you will solve these issues.

- Head over to [GitHub's documentation on how to create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) and read up!

## Exercise

#### Requirements
- Circle up with your squad and share GitHub repositories.  You will be submitting issues for the two members to your left in your squad.
- For each of these two developers' code do the following:

  1. Clone their repo (you do not need to `fork` it, because you will not need to `push` to it.)
  2. Open the developer's app in your browser or go to their app's hosted site online and play around for a few minutes. Think about
    - Are there any bugs?
    - Is there improvement you think the project could make toward meeting requirements?
    - Are there any relatively simple features that could be added to make the experience better? ( A better-organized "new" page is doable.  Adding another 3rd party API, maybe not so much.)
  3. Spend at least 5 minutes looking at their code. Think about
    - Do you see any bad practices? (for example very long methods or poorly named variables)
  4. Take a look at the Issues page on [Garnet's GitHub repo]( https://github.com/ga-dc/garnet/issues) for some examples of how to name issues.
  4. Submit at least 2 (but no more than four) issues.

#### Deliverable

  The four issues you submit on your two fellow developers repos ARE your deliverable.

## Tonight's Assignment

### Make Your Project 2 Apps Portfolio Worthy!

Tonight you will do the following things to make this full-stack app worthy of your Portfolio!

1. If you haven't already, split out your model(s), view(s), and controller(s) into their own directories.
2. Solve *at least two* the issues on your repo, but as many as you reasonably can. Read up on [how to solve an issue and close it with a simple commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
3. Put some extra work into the design of your app. Make it beautiful! Make it modern! Go nuts.

You will also have some time to improve your app over the weekend.  Your result will be a beautiful, functional full-stack app using all the technology concepts that employers usually want their developers to know!
